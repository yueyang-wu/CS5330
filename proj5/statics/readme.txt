- Instructions for running your executables.
    - There are 7 executables, none of them takes any parameters
    - MNISTRecognition.py: for task 1, get data, train and save the model
    - MNISTTest.py: for task 1, load the model trained in MNISTRecognition and test on test dataset and custom written dataset
    - examNetwork.py: for task 2, exam the two convolution layers and plot the results
    - digitEmbeddingSpace.py: for task 3, create a data embedding space using the greek symbol dataset, and compute the distances
    - experiment.py: for task 4, exam the deep network by modifying some different aspects
    - mobilenet.py: for extension 2, load mobilenet from PyTorch and evaluate the first convolution layer
    - digitEmbeddingSpace2.py: for extension 3, use the same truncated model as in task 3.
                                Load a full set of Greek letters, build a KNN classifier, and recognize the Greek letters

    - There is also an utils.py file, which contains the hyper-parameters, Models and helper functions

- Instructions for testing any extensions you completed.
    No extra steps are needed for testing the extensions. Details are in the instructions for running my executables.

- Whether received accommodation for the project or you are using any time travel days and how many.
    Yes, 3 time travel days.
