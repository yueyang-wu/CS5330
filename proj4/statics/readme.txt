- What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code.
    MacOS 12.1 (Monterey)

- Instructions for running your executables.
    - There are two executables: arSystem and harrisCorner
    - arSystem is able to detect chessboard corners and ArUco targets. It can put AR objects on the two targets at the same time
      it can also overlay a picture on the ArUco targets
        - takes one input, the file path to an image, the image is used to overlay the ArUco target
        - type 'p' to display/remove the image from ArUco targets
        - for the two target, the system calibrate the camera separately
        - type 's' to select calibration images for chessboard
        - type 'h' to select calibration images for ArUco target
        - type 'c' to calibrate camera for chessboard (at least 5 calibration image required)
        - type 'x' to calibrate camera for chessboard (at least 5 calibration image required)
        - once the camera is calibrated, it will put a virtual object on the target
    - harrisCorners is able to detect corners and highlight corners
        - takes no input
        - type 'q' to quit the system
