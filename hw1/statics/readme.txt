// CS5330 hw1 (pow vs. *)
// Yueyang Wu

The conclusion is that simple multiplication should always be faster than pow to square two numbers.
I tried both integers and float numbers.
The result.txt file is a sample output.

- Generate 1,000 integers between 1 and 2147483647 and 1000 float numbers between 0.0001 and 9999.9999.
- For each number, square it using pow and multiplication for 10,000 times each.
- Record the time interval of doing each 10,000 operations.
- Compare the time interval and display the result.
